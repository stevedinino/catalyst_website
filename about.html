Her leadership was instrumental in improving quality outcomes, compliance standards, and workforce development across the organization.</p>

    <p>Janet earned her <strong>Master of Science in Nursing Administration and Leadership</strong> and <strong>Bachelor of Science in Nursing</strong> from Western Governors University, and her <strong>Post-Master’s Certificate as an Adult-Gerontology Primary Care Nurse Practitioner</strong> from West Coast University.
